He teaches him how to effectively use a\\n   \\n    sword\\n   \\n   in the game.\\n  \\n\\n   Link, woken in the night by a telepathic plea from\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   , finds his uncle about to leave the house with a\\n   \\n    sword\\n   \\n   and\\n   \\n    shield\\n   \\n   in hand. Seeing Link wake, he tells him not to leave the\\n   house\\n   , promising to return for morning.\\n   Ignoring his instructions, Link sneaks into the palace via the sewers in an attempt to rescue the Princess himself. Here, Link finds his uncle mortally wounded, unable to go on. Entrusting him with the task of saving the Princess, he gives Link his sword and shield and teaches him the\\n   Spin Attack\\n   before dying.\\n  \\n\\n   At the end of the game, after\\n   \\n    Ganon\\n   \\n   has been defeated and Link makes a wish on the Triforce, Link\\'s Uncle is shown to be alive and well in the credits, where he seems to be practicing sword fighting with Link in front of their house.\\n  \\n\\n   In the\\n   Game Boy Advance\\n   version of the game, Link\\'s Uncle appears in the\\n   Palace of the Four Sword\\n   , wounded. However, when Link speaks with him, he transforms into\\n   Blind the Thief\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Appearances\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Non-Canon Information\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      A Link to the Past\\n     \\n     (Ishinomori)\\n    \\n\\n\\n    In the\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    comic\\n    by\\n    \\n     Shotaro Ishinomori\\n    \\n    ,  it is mentioned that Link\\'s Uncle adopted Link  because his parents  stumbled into the Dark World, shielding him from the intrigues of the  Royal Family.\\n   \\n\\n    At the beginning of the comic, Link\\'s Uncle goes to\\n    \\n     Hyrule Castle\\n    \\n    to confront\\n    \\n     Agahnim\\n    \\n    while Link is still asleep. When Link wakes up in\\n    his house\\n    to find that his uncle is missing, he panics but heads to\\n    \\n     Hyrule Castle\\n    \\n    after hearing\\n    \\n     Princess Zelda\\n    \\n    \\'s plead. Link sneaks into the castle and sees his uncle dueling\\n    \\n     Agahnim\\n    \\n    ,  who deals a deadly strike to Link\\'s uncle, saying that anyone who    challenges him will meet their doom, and promptly vanishes afterward.\\n    Link rushes to his uncle\\'s side and receives his\\n    \\n     sword\\n    \\n    and\\n    shield\\n    from him. Before passing out, Link\\'s Uncle explains that after the young hero rescues Zelda and the people in the\\n    Dark World\\n    , he might be able to meet his parents.\\n    After he passes away, Link promises to defeat Agahnim with the use of the Master Sword to avenge his uncle\\'s death.\\n   \\n\\n    Once Link reaches\\n    \\n     Death Mountain\\n    \\n    , he stumbles upon a portal to the\\n    Dark World\\n    , which  activates itself and shows a vision of his parents standing with his uncle.\\n    Link\\'s Uncle is not seen again until the end of the comic after Link defeats\\n    \\n     Ganon\\n    \\n    and peace returns to Hyrule: at Hyrule Castle, Link sees a vision of  his father, mother and uncle,  who  congratulate him on his difficult  victory and tell him to never  forget  the efforts of the many  generations of knights and Wise Men  that preceded him.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Legacy as an Archetype\\n   \\n\\n\\n   The character\\n   Rusl\\n   from\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   may have been inspired by Link\\'s Uncle. They are both swordsmen who serve as Link\\'s mentors and father figures, and are wounded during the game. Additionally, they both have their hair parted in the middle and have facial hair of a different color.\\n  \\n\\n   In official artwork,\\n   Tarin\\n   from\\n   \\n\\n     Link\\'s Awakening\\n    \\n\\n   resembles Link\\'s Uncle. Both are rotund, have big round noses, black hair (Link\\'s Uncle\\'s hair is purple in the game but black in artwork), and large mustaches.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Trivia\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    In the original\\n    \\n     SNES\\n    \\n    version, Link\\'s Uncle begins to say, \"Zelda is your...\" then trails off and dies.\\n    This caused some fans to speculate that the full sentence would have read \"Zelda is your sister\", possibly in relation to the film\\n    \\n     Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\\n    \\n    (less popular sentence endings included \"ally\" and \"only hope\").\\n    The original Japanese version of the game contains a different line –\\n    \\n     お、お前は、姫の…\\u3000…。\\n    \\n    (\\n    \\n     y- you are the Princess\\'s... ...\\n    \\n    ). In the\\n    Game Boy Advance\\n    version, Link\\'s Uncle\\'s last words were changed.\\n    However, the direct translation of the aforementioned line is spoken by\\n    Blind the Thief\\n    when it impersonates Link\\'s Uncle in the\\n    Palace of the Four Sword\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    The official\\n    Japanese soundtrack CD of\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    contained a short radio drama. In it, a young Link was placed under the care of Zelda\\'s nurse, Egorowa, and her husband Alphon - who he calls uncle. It is unclear if this meant to be a preview of a pre-\\n    \\n\\n      Ocarina of Time\\n     \\n\\n    version of the\\n    \\n     Imprisoning War\\n    \\n    or simply an alternate history.\\n   \\n\\n    Link\\'s Uncle is briefly seen in the Japanese commercial for\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    A picture of a man resembling Link\\'s Uncle can be seen on the wall of Link\\'s house in\\n    \\n\\n      A Link Between Worlds\\n     \\n\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Names in Other Regions\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Language\\n     \\n\\n      Name\\n     \\n\\n      Meaning\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Japanese\\n     \\n\\n      おじさん\\xa0(\\n      \\n       Ojisan\\n      \\n      )\\n     \\n\\n      Uncle\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      French\\n     \\n\\n      Oncle\\n     \\n\\n      Uncle\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       This table was generated using\\n       .\\n       To request an addition, please\\n       a\\n       staff member\\n       with a\\n       \\n        reference\\n       \\n       .\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon’s henchmen, though a young swordsman named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa’s plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon. Link located the eight underground labyrinths, defeats several guardian monsters, and retrieves the Triforce fragments. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, Link is able to infiltrate Ganon’s hideout and defeats him with the\\n   \\n    Silver Arrow\\n   \\n   . Link picks up the Triforce of Power from Ganon’s ashes and returns both pieces of the Triforce to Princess Zelda, restoring peace to Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     The Adventure of Link\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    The Adventure of Link\\n   \\n   , set six years after\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   , the now-sixteen-year-old Link notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand, resembling the crest of Hyrule.\\n   He seeks out Impa, who responds by taking Link to the\\n   \\n    North Castle\\n   \\n   , where a door has been magically sealed for generations. Impa places the back of Link\\'s left hand on the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden inside. Impa tells Link that the maiden is the original Princess Zelda of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the \"Legend of Zelda\". Long ago, Zelda\\'s brother, the\\n   \\n    Prince of Hyrule\\n   \\n   , had tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father\\'s secrets concerning the last of the three golden treasures of his kingdom,  the Triforce of Courage. Princess Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the\\n   \\n    Magician\\n   \\n   , who had accompanied the prince, tried to strike her down with a spell in anger. Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it. The prince, filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, in the hope that she would one day be awakened. He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy. Impa says that the mark on Link\\'s hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the\\n   \\n    Great Palace\\n   \\n   , which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, although Link had defeated Ganon, the remnants of his army remain scattered across Hyrule. They plan to revive Ganon by killing Link and spilling his blood onto Ganon\\'s ashes.\\n  \\n\\n   Ultimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces, defeating a strong guardian within each one to do so, and enters the Great Palace. After venturing deep inside, Link battles a flying creature known as the\\n   Thunderbird\\n   , followed by his own\\n   \\n    shadow\\n   \\n   guarding the Triforce. After defeating them both, Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce, and Link\\'s wish awakens Zelda.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    A Link to the Past\\n   \\n   , Link lives with his\\n   \\n    uncle\\n   \\n   in a house near Hyrule Castle. During this time, the land of Hyrule was plagued by a sudden disaster, until the wizard\\n   \\n    Agahnim\\n   \\n   appeared at the court of the\\n   King of Hyrule\\n   and quelled the upheaval. Named chief adviser to the throne, he soon seized power from the king and kidnapped the six\\n   \\n    Maidens\\n   \\n   , descendants of the seven Sages of long ago. The Maidens were taken to the castle tower and never seen again. One night, Link is awakened by a telepathic message from Princess Zelda, who says that she is locked in the castle dungeon. As the message closes, Link finds his uncle ready for battle, telling Link to remain in bed. After his uncle leaves, however, Link ignores his uncle\\'s command and follows him to the dungeons under the castle. When he arrives, he finds his uncle mortally wounded. Link\\'s uncle tells Link to rescue Princess Zelda from her prison, giving him his sword and shield. Link navigates the castle and rescues Zelda from her cell, and the two escape into a secret passage through the sewers that leads to the\\n   Sanctuary\\n   , where they meet the\\n   Loyal Sage\\n   . Link is informed that Agahnim intends to open the seal to the\\n   \\n    Dark World\\n   \\n   , a realm once sealed off long ago by the seven Sages when Ganon and his army of evil were banished into the Sacred Realm, which became the Dark World. The kidnapped Maidens were sent into the Dark World to open this seal, and Agahnim intended to do the same to Zelda. Link is told by the man that the only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, and the Sage tells him to seek the elder\\n   \\n    Sahasrahla\\n   \\n   to learn more.\\n  \\n\\n   Link finds the elder near the\\n   Eastern Palace\\n   . To prove that he is worthy to wield the Master Sword, Sahasrahla sends Link to find the three\\n   \\n    Pendants of Virtue\\n   \\n   , hidden in dungeons across Hyrule and guarded by mythical defenders. Sahasrahla becomes Link\\'s mentor, offering him hints and advice at key stages of his journey. After retrieving the Pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword deep in the\\n   \\n    Lost Woods\\n   \\n   . As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that\\n   soldiers\\n   of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sage that Zelda has been taken back to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World which opens the seal. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but fails to kill him as Agahnim teleports Link to the Dark World as well.\\n  \\n\\n   To save Hyrule, Link is required to rescue the seven captive Maidens from dungeons scattered across the Dark World. Once the seven Maidens are freed, including Princess Zelda, they use their power to break the barrier around\\n   Ganon\\'s Tower\\n   , where Link faces Agahnim again. Link defeats him a second time, and Ganon rises from Agahnim\\'s body and flies away. Link chases after him, finally confronting him inside the\\n   \\n    Pyramid of Power\\n   \\n   at the center of the Dark World. After a battle resulting in Ganon\\'s demise, Link touches the Triforce and restores both the Dark World and Hyrule to their former state before Ganon intervened.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Link\\'s Awakening\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Link\\'s Awakening\\n   \\n   ,\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   is seen aboard his ship after leaving Hyrule; however, he is soon caught in a deadly thunderstorm which results in the destruction of his ship. His unconscious body is later found by\\n   \\n    Marin\\n   \\n   on a faraway island\\'s shores. When he awakes, he discovers that he had miraculously been washed ashore on\\n   Koholint Island\\n   and makes preparations to leave it by first finding his missing\\n   Sword\\n   . A mysterious\\n   Owl\\n   then approaches\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   and tells him about a sleeping being on\\n   \\n    Koholint Island\\n   \\n   , the\\n   Wind Fish\\n   , and that\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   can only leave the\\n   \\n    Island\\n   \\n   once the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   has been awoken from its eternal slumber. To awaken the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   ,\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   had to embark on a long journey and go through many\\n   \\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n   to retrieve the\\n   Instruments of the Sirens\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Link\\n   \\n   is eventually instructed by the\\n   \\n    Owl\\n   \\n   to go to the\\n   Ancient Ruins\\n   where he reads the\\n   Writing on the Wall\\n   and discovers the startling truth about\\n   \\n    Koholint Island\\n   \\n   . It is but a dream inside the mind of the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   which has been invaded by\\n   Nightmares\\n   and who is unable to awaken. If the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   awakes,\\n   \\n    Koholint Island\\n   \\n   will disappear.\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   had been pulled into the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   \\'s dream world and is now the only one who can awaken it. He eventually acquires all eight\\n   \\n    Instruments of the Sirens\\n   \\n   and defeats all of the\\n   \\n    Nightmares\\n   \\n   , thus awaking the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   . As\\n   \\n    Koholint Island\\n   \\n   fades away,\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   is forced out by a stream of water and awakens to find himself on a wooden board, back in the ocean. When he looks up, he sees the\\n   \\n    Wind Fish\\n   \\n   flying overhead and smiles.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Link as a child in\\n     \\n      Ocarina of Time\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   , Child Link has been raised as one of the\\n   \\n    Kokiri\\n   \\n   , the children of\\n   \\n    Kokiri Forest\\n   \\n   . Unlike the other Kokiri, Link does not have a\\n   \\n    Fairy\\n   \\n   companion and is thus shunned by their self-proclaimed leader,\\n   Mido\\n   . Link has a nightmare involving a princess fleeing from a man who then attacks him. The boy\\'s life changes one day when the\\n   \\n    Great Deku Tree\\n   \\n   , the forest\\'s guardian, sends\\n   Navi\\n   the Fairy to Link with instructions to bring him immediately. A curse has been cast on the Great Deku Tree, and he asks Link to break it. While Link is successful in defeating the monsters inside the Tree, the Great Deku Tree was doomed to die before Link started.\\n   He had been cursed by a man named\\n   \\n    Ganondorf\\n   \\n   , as revenge for not giving him the\\n   Kokiri\\'s Emerald\\n   . He warns Link that this evil man seeks the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   , and fears a great calamity will befall Hyrule should he seize it. Before passing away, the Great Deku Tree directs Link to\\n   \\n    Hyrule Castle\\n   \\n   where he is to find\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Link as an adult in\\n     \\n      Ocarina of Time\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the\\n   \\n    Hyrule Castle\\n   \\n   garden, Link meets Princess Zelda. She believes that Ganondorf is seeking the Triforce. Zelda\\'s description of Ganondorf matches that of the man who killed the Great Deku Tree, as well as the man from Link\\'s nightmare. Zelda asks Link to obtain the three\\n   \\n    Spiritual Stones\\n   \\n   so that he can enter the\\n   \\n    Sacred Realm\\n   \\n   and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it, and ultimately save Hyrule. Link collects the other two stones: the first from\\n   \\n    Darunia\\n   \\n   , the leader of the\\n   \\n    Gorons\\n   \\n   , and the second from\\n   \\n    Ruto\\n   \\n   , the princess of the\\n   \\n    Zoras\\n   \\n   . Link returns to Hyrule Castle, where Ganondorf is pursuing Zelda and her caretaker Impa on horseback, as in his earlier nightmare. Link attempts to stop Ganondorf, who warns him not to interfere with his plans. After Ganondorf rides off, Link retrieves the\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   that Zelda had left behind for him. Inside the\\n   \\n    Temple of Time\\n   \\n   , Link uses the Ocarina of Time and the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm. Through the door, Link finds the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   , a legendary sword forged to destroy evil. As he pulls the Master Sword from its pedestal, Link is sealed away, and Ganondorf appears and claims the Triforce for himself. Seven years later, an older Link is awakened as the\\n   Hero of Time\\n   by\\n   \\n    Rauru\\n   \\n   , the\\n   \\n    Sage\\n   \\n   of Light.\\n   Rauru explains that Link\\'s spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf, who is now the King of Evil. The seven Sages can imprison Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but five are not aware of their identities as Sages. Link is returned to the Temple of Time; there he meets the mysterious\\n   \\n    Sheik\\n   \\n   , who guides him to temples under Ganondorf\\'s control. Link defeats the evil lurking in each temple, thus awakening Saria, Darunia, Ruto, Impa and\\n   \\n    Nabooru\\n   \\n   as the Sages. Link also returns to the Kokiri Forest, where he finds that none of his friends have grown up, and most now no longer recognize him.\\n   After awakening Saria as a Sage, Link also finds that the\\n   Deku Tree Sprout\\n   has sprouted as the successor to the Great Deku Tree. He reveals Link\\'s hidden past and explains to him that he is not a Kokiri, but actually a\\n   \\n    Hylian\\n   \\n   , orphaned in the\\n   \\n    wars\\n   \\n   that raged before Hyrule was united. While in the\\n   \\n    Lost Woods\\n   \\n   ,\\n   Fado\\n   also references the fact that Link is not a Kokiri by asking Link if he is going to become a Stalfos.\\n   When Link was a baby, his mother fled with him to Kokiri Forest and, mortally wounded, left him under the Deku Tree\\'s protection. He was brought up as one of the Kokiri and knew no differently.\\n  \\n\\n   After the five Sages awaken, Sheik reveals herself to be Princess Zelda in disguise and the seventh Sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf\\'s heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces. Ganondorf acquired only the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Power\\n   \\n   , while Zelda received the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Wisdom\\n   \\n   and Link the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Courage\\n   \\n   . Ganondorf then kidnaps Zelda and imprisons her in his\\n   \\n    castle\\n   \\n   . The other six Sages help Link enter the castle, where he fights to the evil king\\'s sanctum. There, Link frees Zelda and nearly defeats Ganondorf, but he destroys the castle in an attempt to kill Link and Zelda. After the duo escapes the collapsing castle, Ganondorf emerges from the rubble and engages Link. Using the Triforce of Power, he transforms from his human form into a boar-like monster named Ganon and immediately knocks the Master Sword from Link\\'s hand. With Zelda\\'s aid, Link retrieves the Master Sword and defeats Ganon. The seven Sages then seal Ganondorf into the Dark Realm. The battle now over, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his original time to live out his childhood, at which point Navi departs. He is last seen when he encounters Princess Zelda again in the Castle Courtyard to warn her about Ganondorf and the future events that would unfold.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Majora\\'s Mask\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Majora\\'s Mask\\n   \\n   occurs shortly after\\n   \\n    Ganondorf\\n   \\n   \\'s defeat when Link is sent back to his childhood at the end of\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   , beginning a new history in which Ganondorf never rose to power. After leaving Hyrule and riding deep into a mysterious forest in search of\\n   Navi\\n   ,\\n   he is ambushed by a\\n   \\n    Skull Kid\\n   \\n   who is possessed by\\n   \\n    Majora\\'s Mask\\n   \\n   , who steals Link\\'s horse\\n   \\n    Epona\\n   \\n   and the magical Ocarina of Time. Chasing the Skull Kid, Link falls into a crevasse and arrives in a world called\\n   \\n    Termina\\n   \\n   . He must save this land from the evil of Majora\\'s Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, which will cause it to crash into Termina\\'s capital city in three days, killing everyone. Link uses the\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   (reclaimed early on) and the\\n   \\n    Song of Time\\n   \\n   , which sends him back in time when he plays it, to relive these three days again and again in order to prevent the disaster. Along the way, Link finds many magical masks of his own, a handful of which allow him to transform. Those masks can turn him into a rock-like\\n   \\n    Goron\\n   \\n   , a petite plant-like\\n   Deku Scrub\\n   , a graceful aquatic\\n   \\n    Zora\\n   \\n   , or the powerful\\n   Fierce Deity Link\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   Eventually, Link succeeds in freeing the Four Giants, enigmatic deities who can halt the Moon\\'s descent, and confronts the Skull Kid. At this point, Majora, the evil entity residing inside Majora\\'s Mask, abandons its now useless host and retreats into the core of the Moon. Link give chase, and after a long and heated battle against the three incarnations of Majora, the entity is finally defeated and the menacing Moon disappears. Upon returning the now lifeless mask to the Happy Mask Salesman, Link leaves his new friends and continues his journey, while the people of Termina once more celebrate the dawn of a new day. It is unknown whether or not he returned to Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n   During his life after\\n   \\n    Majora\\'s Mask\\n   \\n   , up until and after his death, he lamented the fact that he was not remembered as a hero despite saving both Hyrule and Termina, and was unable to pass on his skills and teachings to the next generation. In order to ease his regrets and finally pass on his knowledge, he teaches the seven Hidden Skills to his descendant, the Link of\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Oracle of Seasons\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Oracle of Seasons\\n   \\n   , Link is summoned by the Triforce to save the land of\\n   \\n    Holodrum\\n   \\n   . Upon his arrival, he is cared for by a young girl named\\n   \\n    Din\\n   \\n   who takes him to meet the troupe of performers that she\\'s a part of; however, soon after,\\n   \\n    General Onox\\n   \\n   appears and captures Din, revealing that she is actually the Oracle of Seasons who was just disguising herself as a dancer. The seasons soon begin to go out of control now that Din has been kidnapped, and it is up to Link to return Holodrum back to normal. With the help of the\\n   \\n    Rod of Seasons\\n   \\n   , Link acquires the eight\\n   \\n    Essences of Nature\\n   \\n   scattered all over the land in order to restore the\\n   \\n    Maku Tree\\n   \\n   \\'s power and enter\\n   Onox\\'s Castle\\n   . After the young hero defeats the evil menace and rescues the Oracle of Seasons, peace returns to Holodrum and the order of nature is back to its normal state.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Oracle of Ages\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Oracle of Ages\\n   \\n   , soon after\\n   \\n    Oracle of Seasons\\n   \\n   , Link is again summoned by the Triforce to save the land of\\n   \\n    Labrynna\\n   \\n   . Upon landing, he hears a cry for help, and he soon finds that\\n   \\n    Impa\\n   \\n   , Zelda\\'s caretaker, is being surrounded by monsters. Link easily scares them off, and Impa asks that he help her search for a woman named\\n   \\n    Nayru\\n   \\n   . After finding Nayru, it is revealed that\\n   \\n    Veran\\n   \\n   , the Sorceress of Shadows, possessed Impa in order to manipulate Link into leading her to Nayru, who turns out to be the Oracle of Ages. Veran quickly takes over Nayru\\'s body, which she uses to alter events in the past to ruin the future. It is Link who, with the help of the\\n   \\n    Harp of Ages\\n   \\n   , travels through time in order to rescue the Oracle and restore the ages back to normal. After Link frees Nayru from Veran\\'s possession, the Oracle of Ages teaches the young hero a\\n   song\\n   crucial to his quest in collecting the eight\\n   \\n    Essences of Time\\n   \\n   scattered over the land of Labrynna. Unfortunately, soon after, the Sorceress of Shadows possesses\\n   Ambi\\n   , the queen of Labrynna in the past, and takes refuge in the\\n   Black Tower\\n   . Link, with all the Essences in hand, heads over to the sinister tower to defeat Veran once and for all. After this adventure, Link sets sail to an unknown destination aboard a ship.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Four Swords\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Four Swords\\n   \\n   , when Link takes the Four Sword, he is divided into four different Links (Green, Blue, Red and Purple), each with their own style and personality. Working together, the\\n   \\n    Links\\n   \\n   must find 3 keys that lead to Princess Zelda, who was captured by\\n   \\n    Vaati\\n   \\n   the wind mage. Link travels with Princess Zelda to check on the Four Sword, a legendary blade said to seal Vaati, a powerful wind mage. As the two enter the Four Sword Sanctuary, Vaati breaks his seal, absconding with Zelda in order to make her his bride. As Link comes to, he is instructed by three Fairies to draw the Four Sword, which splits the hero into four copies of himself: one green, one red, one blue, and one purple. Together, the four Links journey across Hyrule to meet three Great Fairies, each of whom gives the Links a key necessary to enter Vaati\\'s Palace. Inside, the four Links defeat Vaati after a fierce battle, sealing him inside the Four Sword once more. With Hyrule saved, the four heroes return the Four Sword to its pedestal, thus merging back into one being.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     The Wind Waker\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Link & the King of Red Lions (\\n      Figurine\\n      from\\n      \\n\\n        The Wind Waker\\n       \\n\\n      )\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Link & the King of Red Lions\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Birthplace:\\n      Outset Island\\n      Favored Hand: Left\\n      The Hero of Wind, Link uses the Wind Waker to control the wind and sail the seas on his mysterious boat (which is actually the King of Hyrule).\\n      Surprisingly, he seems to have an unnatural interest in figurines and has at last completed his collection! He is now the master of the Nintendo Gallery.\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   After the valleys of ancient\\n   \\n    Hyrule\\n   \\n   are flooded in a deluge, Ganondorf\\'s power is mysteriously tamed for ages before his dark energy begins to be felt over the\\n   \\n    Great Sea\\n   \\n   . Link lives on Outset Island on the Great Sea, the region above Hyrule after it was flooded by the gods to prevent Ganondorf from conquering it. Link is given the green tunic and hat on his birthday to commemorate the Hero of Time,\\n   but an attack by the\\n   \\n    Helmaroc King\\n   \\n   in which his sister is kidnapped starts him on a whirlwind adventure. Link quickly sets sail and acquires the\\n   \\n    King of Red Lions\\n   \\n   in his quest to recover Aryll after she is kidnapped by the\\n   \\n    Helmaroc King\\n   \\n   and taken to the\\n   \\n    Forsaken Fortress\\n   \\n   . Instead of simply rescuing his sister, Link is drawn into a sequence of events that eventually puts the fate of all the islands of the Great Sea in his hands. Once again,\\n   \\n    Ganon\\n   \\n   has appeared with limited power. Link is pulled into the conflict between the island inhabitants and Ganondorf\\'s increasing presence as he, with the help of the\\n   \\n    Wind Waker\\n   \\n   , races to recapture the ancient power of the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   and the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   before Ganondorf\\'s true power is realized.\\n  \\n\\n   Eventually, the King of Red Lions sees fit to grant Link the title\\n   \\n    Hero of Winds\\n   \\n   in honor of his ongoing struggle with the forces of evil.\\n   In the final showdown Link defeats Ganondorf for good, stabbing him in the head with the Master Sword. The King of Hyrule\\'s wish with the Triforce was to give Link and\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   a future, and at the end of the game they set out to find a new land to be the next kingdom after Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Four Swords Adventures\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Concerned that the seal which keeps Vaati in the Four Sword may be weakening, Zelda and the rest of the Seven Maidens summon Link and open the way to the shrine of the Four Sword to investigate. However, Zelda and the other maidens are captured and imprisoned by\\n   \\n    Shadow Link\\n   \\n   . Despite the fact that it will release Vaati, Link is forced to draw the Four Sword from its pedestal in order to split himself into four and have the strength to go and rescue the maidens. The Links save all seven of them and collect the four Royal Jewels, which they use to reveal the Tower of Winds. When he followed Shadow Link down to the\\n   Four Sword Sanctuary\\n   , he pulled the Four Sword splitting him into four like in the original Four Swords, but when he pulled the sword\\n   \\n    Vaati\\n   \\n   was released from the seal once again. After the Links saved Zelda and the maidens, got the four\\n   Royal Jewels\\n   from different heroes of Hyrule, and defeated Vaati, Zelda and the Links fought against the dark lord\\n   \\n    Ganon\\n   \\n   and, with the help of the Seven Maidens, seal him within the Four Sword and restored peace to Hyrule. The sword is then returned to its sanctuary and sealed there, and the Links are combined into one again.\\n  \\n\\n   This incarnation of Link is given the title \"\\n   \\n    Hero of Light\\n   \\n

returning back to the world of the\\n   \\n    Minish\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   , Link is a youth who has been raised as a wrangler outside of\\n   \\n    Hyrule\\n   \\n   territory in\\n   Ordon Village\\n   . He is fascinated by swordsmanship and horse riding.\\n   His mentor,\\n   Rusl\\n   , requests that Link go in his place to deliver a sword he has made for the\\n   \\n    Royal Family of Hyrule\\n   \\n   . Before Link can go on this journey, his village is attacked by\\n   \\n    King Bulblin\\n   \\n   and his band of\\n   \\n    Bulblins\\n   \\n   , who carry off the village children. Pursuing them, Link encounters a wall of\\n   \\n    Twilight\\n   \\n   blocking the way. A\\n   \\n    Shadow Beast\\n   \\n   pulls him beyond the wall into the Twilight, where he is transformed into a\\n   \\n    wolf\\n   \\n   and imprisoned in Hyrule Castle\\'s dungeon. Link is soon freed by an imp-like\\n   \\n    Twili\\n   \\n   being named\\n   \\n    Midna\\n   \\n   . She agrees to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda in the castle tower. Zelda explains that\\n   \\n    Zant\\n   \\n   , the King of Twilight, has stolen the light from three of the four\\n   \\n    Spirits of Light\\n   \\n   and conquered Hyrule. In order to save the kingdom, Link must first restore the Light Spirits by entering the Twilight-covered areas and, as a wolf, recover the Spirits\\' lost light. Accompanied by Midna, Link restores the light to the Light Spirit\\n   Faron\\n   and is returned to his Hylian form. During this time, Link also helps Midna locate the fragments of the\\n   \\n    Fused Shadow\\n   \\n   , relics containing powerful dark magic. In return, she helps Link find Ordon Village\\'s kidnapped children. Once Link has restored the Light Spirits and found all of the Fused Shadow Fragments, they are suddenly ambushed by Zant. After he relieves Midna of the Fused Shadow fragments, she ridicules him for abusing his tribe\\'s magic, but Zant responds that his power comes from another source as he uses it to turn Link back into a wolf. He then leaves Midna to die from the world\\'s light forced upon her, prompting Link to bring her to Zelda to help her. Link learns that he needs the Master Sword to return to human form. Zelda sacrifices herself to heal Midna with her power before vanishing mysteriously. Moved by her sacrifice, Midna agrees to help Link find the Master Sword. After finding the legendary blade, Link is cleansed of the magic that kept him in wolf form, transforming it into the\\n   Shadow Crystal\\n   . Using this crystal, Link is able to switch between both forms at will.\\n  \\n\\n   Midna leads Link to the\\n   \\n    Mirror of Twilight\\n   \\n   located deep within the\\n   \\n    Gerudo Desert\\n   \\n   , the only known gateway between the\\n   \\n    Twilight Realm\\n   \\n   and Hyrule. However, they discover that the mirror is shattered. The ghostly Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground group called\\n   \\n    The Resistance\\n   \\n   , they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the mirror, defeating those they infected. Once the portal is restored, Midna is revealed to be the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, usurped by Zant when he cursed her into her current form. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that Zant\\'s coup was made possible when he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for Zant\\'s assistance in conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows, but destroys Zant after learning that only Ganondorf\\'s death can release her from her curse. Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, with a lifeless Zelda suspended above his head. Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda\\'s body and eventually by transforming into a beast, but Link defeats him and Midna is able to resurrect Zelda. Ganondorf then revives, and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadow. However, as Hyrule Castle collapses, it is revealed that Ganondorf was victorious as he crushes Midna\\'s helmet. Ganondorf engages Link on horseback, and, assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits, Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before Link strikes down Ganondorf and plunges the Master Sword into his chest. With Ganondorf dead, the Light Spirits not only bring Midna back to life, but restore her to her true form. After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda, Midna returns home before destroying the Mirror of Twilight with a tear to maintain balance between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm. Near the end, as Hyrule Castle is rebuilt, Link leaves Ordon Village heading to parts unknown.\\n  \\n\\n   This incarnation of Link is given the title \"\\n   \\n    Hero of Twilight\\n   \\n   .\"\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Phantom Hourglass\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Link appears yet again in his youngest form in Phantom Hourglass. The events of\\n   \\n    Phantom Hourglass\\n   \\n   takes place months after Ganon\\'s defeat at the end of\\n   \\n    The Wind Waker\\n   \\n   . Link is a child sailing with\\n   \\n    Tetra\\n   \\n   and her crew in search of the\\n   Ghost Ship\\n   . When they find it, Tetra jumps aboard but is kidnapped, so Link goes after her but instead falls into the sea.\\n   Link is awakened on\\n   Mercay Island\\n   by a\\n   \\n    fairy\\n   \\n   , and they set out on a journey to find Tetra. Link and Ciela traverse the\\n   \\n    World of the Ocean King\\n   \\n   , rescuing the Spirits of the Ocean King and Tetra, and forging the\\n   Phantom Sword\\n   which can slay\\n   Bellum\\n   , the devil behind all this misfortune. At the end of the game, Oshus returns Link, Tetra, and\\n   Linebeck\\n   to their world, thanking them for their help.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Spirit Tracks\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Spirit Tracks\\n   \\n   , taking place many years after the Hero of Winds found the\\n   \\n    new Hyrule\\n   \\n   , Link is a child who lives with\\n   Niko\\n   in\\n   Aboda Village\\n   . He is an apprentice of a master engineer, named\\n   \\n    Alfonzo\\n   \\n   , who has helped him in order to become a\\n   Royal Engineer\\n   . When Zelda presents Link with a\\n   certificate\\n   for this achievement,\\n   she also gives him a letter, telling him to meet with her, to discuss her suspicions over the mysterious\\n   Chancellor Cole\\n   as well as the disappearing\\n   Spirit Tracks\\n   . When Link sneaks Zelda out of the\\n   \\n    Castle\\n   \\n   , they meet up with Alfonzo, who escorts them to the\\n   \\n    Tower of Spirits\\n   \\n   by train. However, as the Spirit Tracks begin to fade, they crash, and are then ambushed by the chancellor, who attacks the trio. Link and his master are knocked unconscious while Zelda\\'s spirit is separated from her body, which is seized by Cole\\'s apprentice,\\n   Byrne\\n   . Link awakes back in\\n   \\n    Hyrule Castle\\n   \\n   to discover that Zelda is now a ghost and that Link is the only person who can see her. After visiting\\n   \\n    Anjean\\n   \\n   in the Tower of Spirits, he agrees to help her in defeating Chancellor Cole and recover her body in the process.\\n  \\n\\n   After Link and Zelda travel up to the Tower of Spirits to recover a\\n   Rail Map\\n   , a Phantom Knight attacks him, but Zelda charges at the Phantom just in time to take control of its body. After this, Link and Zelda begin their journey to restore the Tower of Spirits and the Spirit Tracks, traveling across the overworld using the\\n   Spirit Train\\n   that is granted to Link by\\n   \\n    Anjean\\n   \\n   . Whenever Link returns to the Spirit Tower to obtain another Rail Map, Princess Zelda possesses a Phantom\\'s armor in order to aid the young hero. As the pair continues to travel, Link and Zelda establish a close friendship as the two get to know each other better.\\n  \\n\\n   Once Princess Zelda recovers her body from Malladus with the aid of Link, the two together face up against the Demon King, who has now taken over Chancellor Cole\\'s body. Together, Link and Zelda deal the final blow on Malladus using the\\n   Lokomo Sword\\n   , and shortly after, Anjean and the rest of the Lokomos depart towards the heavens. As they leave, Anjean entrusts Princess Zelda to watch over the land, asking Link to help her as well.\\n   Link and Zelda are then seen holding hands as they witness the departure of the Lokomos. Unlike other instances where Link departs from the land after having saved it, the young hero stays in Hyrule to fulfill Anjean\\'s request, where he continues to be either an engineer or a warrior, depending on which Link chose. This is witnessed when Princess Zelda gets up from her seat in her office and waves out the window after having heard either a train\\'s whistle or the clanking of swords.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Skyward Sword\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Skyward Sword\\n   \\n   , Link has lived his entire life on the floating island of\\n   \\n    Skyloft\\n   \\n   , situated above the clouds. He is childhood friends with\\n   \\n    Zelda\\n   \\n   , and they attend the\\n   Knight Academy\\n   together, where he is often bullied by rival student\\n   Groose\\n   .\\n   Link and the other students prepare for the annual\\n   \\n    Wing Ceremony\\n   \\n   , an important part of the initiation of new knights of Skyloft. After the ceremony, Link and Zelda go for a flight together on their\\n   \\n    Loftwings\\n   \\n   , when Zelda and her Loftwing are pulled below the clouds during a sudden and unusual storm. That night, Link is visited by\\n   \\n    Fi\\n   \\n   , a being sent by the goddess\\n   \\n    Hylia\\n   \\n   in order to help him search for Zelda on\\n   the Surface\\n   . Fi leads Link to the\\n   \\n    Goddess Sword\\n   \\n   , and the following day, he ventures to the Surface. On the Surface, Link meets an\\n   \\n    old woman\\n   \\n   in the\\n   Sealed Temple\\n   at the\\n   Sealed Grounds\\n   . This woman assures Link that Zelda is safe and has embarked on a quest of her own, and that he needs to continue to track her. While searching for Zelda, Link discovers that Zelda is also being followed by two other people:\\n   \\n    Impa\\n   \\n   , a servant of Hylia sent to protect Zelda on her quest; and\\n   \\n    Ghirahim\\n   \\n   , a self-proclaimed demon lord who claims responsibility for the storm that dragged Zelda to the Surface.\\n  \\n\\n   Eventually, Link finally catches up to Zelda with Impa at the ancient\\n   \\n    Temple of Time\\n   \\n   , but their reunion is cut short when Ghirahim finds and attacks the duo. Impa holds Ghirahim at bay as Zelda grants Link the\\n   \\n    Goddess\\'s Harp\\n   \\n   . He then holds off Ghirahim in order for Zelda and Impa to escape through the\\n   \\n    Gate of Time\\n   \\n   , which Impa destroys as soon as she and Zelda are through. Back at the Sealed Temple, the old woman shows Link a similar portal that leads to the same place as the portal at the Temple of Time, and explains that Link needs to strengthen the Goddess Sword in order to use the portal. In order to strengthen the sword, Link must temper it in the\\n   Sacred Flames\\n   hidden in various places on the Surface. Before he can set out on his new quest, however, a giant beast known as\\n   \\n    The Imprisoned\\n   \\n   , which was sealed in a pit outside the temple, breaks its seal and begins to climb toward the temple. With great effort, Link stops it and reseals it before it can reach the temple, and then sets out in order to find the Sacred Flames. After passing the three\\n   \\n    trials\\n   \\n   of the goddess,\\n   gaining spiritual growth,\\n   and transforming the Goddess Sword into the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   ,\\n   Link returns to the portal in the Sealed Temple. Before he can use the portal, the Imprisoned breaks its seal again. Link reseals the creature again with the aid of Groose, who had followed Link to the Surface on his second visit to the Sealed Temple. Link then enters the second Gate of Time and reunites with Zelda, who explains that Link is the goddess\\'s chosen hero,\\n   before telling him that she, as Hylia\\'s mortal reincarnation, must remain in a deep sleep to keep the demon king\\n   \\n    Demise\\n   \\n   , the true form of the Imprisoned, sealed within his prison.\\n   She then informs Link that he must find and use the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   to destroy Demise so that she will be able to wake up in their own time.\\n  \\n\\n   Link sets out to the\\n   \\n    Sky Keep\\n   \\n   and obtains the Triforce, using its might to wish for the eradication of Demise.\\n   Zelda is finally released from her duty in the present, but shortly after, Ghirahim abducts her and transports her to the past, planning to resurrect Demise in that time period.\\n   Despite Link\\'s attempts to stop him, Ghirahim sacrifices Zelda\\'s soul to Demise, thus allowing Demise to break free of his seal. Link then challenges Demise, who is impressed with Link\\'s courage, and thus accepts the challenge. Ultimately, Link defeats Ghirahim and Demise, and seals the remains of the demon king in the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   . But before being sealed, Demise warns him that his hatred will be\\n   \\n    reborn as a being\\n   \\n   to pursue domination of the world, as well as those with the\\n   \\n    blood of the goddess\\n   \\n   and spirit of the hero, in a cycle without end.\\n   Back in the present, Zelda decides to remain on the Surface, and wonders what Link plans to do.\\n   Link smiles, hinting that he, too, plans to stay on the Surface with Zelda and help her watch over the Triforce.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     A Link Between Worlds\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    A Link Between Worlds\\n   \\n   , Link dreams that he is in an unknown realm with a\\n   \\n    familiar character\\n   \\n   . He is about to engage in battle, but\\n   Gulley\\n   comes into Link\\'s room and wakes him up from his sleep. In the\\n   Blacksmith\\'s Forge\\n   , the\\n   Captain\\n   of the Guard comes to pick up the new sword that the\\n   \\n    Blacksmith\\n   \\n   forged for him. But he forgets it as he leaves, and Link is sent to return it to him. Shortly afterward, he encounters Yuga, who has transformed the Captain into a\\n   \\n    Painting\\n   \\n   on the\\n   Sanctuary\\n   \\'s wall after he tried to defend\\n   Seres\\n   , the\\n   Priest\\n   \\'s daughter. He then traps Seres herself in a Painting. Using the\\n   Forgotten Sword\\n   , Link attacks Yuga, but Yuga evades the attack by\\n   Wall Merging\\n   . Link crashes into the wall and is knocked unconscious. After this, Yuga leaves with Seres\\' Painting in hand. Link eventually wakes up in his house and meets a mysterious person named\\n   \\n    Ravio\\n   \\n   . After telling Ravio about Yuga, Link is instructed to go see\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   . Asking if he can stay in Link\\'s house, Ravio gives him a strange bracelet in exchange. When Link meets Zelda, she gives him the Pendant of Courage and tells him to go meet\\n   \\n    Sahasrahla\\n   \\n   . Once Link does this, he is then told to find\\n   Osfala\\n   , who is in the Eastern Palace, and is a descendant of the\\n   \\n    Seven Sages\\n   \\n   . Sahasrahla worries that Yuga may go after him next. Link meets Osfala at the entrance to the Eastern Palace, but Osfala simply laughs off Link\\'s warning about Yuga, telling the young hero that he is just as powerful as the Seven Sages were. He then leaves to confront Yuga. However, after traversing the Eastern Palace, Link runs into Yuga yet again, who turns Osfala into a Painting, just as he did Seres. Link battles Yuga, managing to best him with the help of the\\n   \\n    Bow\\n   \\n   he rented from Ravio. In a fit of rage, Yuga traps Link as a Painting and leaves. However, Link escapes with the help of\\n   Ravio\\'s Bracelet\\n   and discovers he could now turn himself into a Painting and back at will with the bracelet.\\n  \\n\\n   Meanwhile, having collected the Seven Sages, Yuga quickly takes over\\n   \\n    Hyrule Castle\\n   \\n   . Link meets Sahasrahla again, who instructs Link to obtain the Pendants of Courage, Wisdom, and Power. Only then will he be able to wield the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   in order to access the castle. After completing this task, Link obtains the Master Sword and delves into the castle, where he finds Yuga with a Painting of Zelda. Yuga then escapes through a mysterious crack in the wall via his ability to Wall Merge. Link pursues Yuga to the other side, where Yuga has begun the process of reviving the evil Ganon, using the power of the Sages to do so. Once Ganon is resurrected, Yuga merges with him, becoming even more powerful. Link is saved by\\n   \\n    Princess Hilda\\n   \\n   and is told he is in the kingdom of\\n   \\n    Lorule\\n   \\n   - a counterpart of his own Hyrule. Link is then given a new task - to rescue and awaken the Seven Sages. Upon awakening all of the Sages, Link is granted the power of the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Courage\\n   \\n   . After Hilda\\'s failed attempt to steal the Triforce from him to save her kingdom, Link faces off against\\n   Yuga Ganon\\n   and defeats him. Afterwards, Link and Zelda are taken to the Lorulean version of the\\n   \\n    Sacred Realm\\n   \\n   , through which they return home to their own Sacred Realm. There, they find Hyrule\\'s Triforce and wish for the Lorulean Triforce to be restored. After the credits, Link returns the Master Sword to its pedestal.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Tri Force Heroes\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Tri Force Heroes\\n    \\n\\n   , Link passes through the kingdom of\\n   \\n    Hytopia\\n   \\n   on his travels after certain, undisclosed events. He is the same hero from\\n   \\n    A Link Between Worlds\\n   \\n   , and dresses differently to hide his heroic origins.\\n   While passing through Hytopia, however, he is spotted by an\\n   assistant\\n   of\\n   \\n    Madame Couture\\n   \\n   , who recognizes his traits of having pointed ears, long sideburns, and side-parted hair. According to a prophecy in the land, these are the traits characteristic of the fabled Tri Force Heroes. Link learns that the kingdom\\'s princess,\\n   \\n    Styla\\n   \\n   , has been cursed by a\\n   witch\\n   to wear an irremovable, tacky outfit. Her father,\\n   King Tuft\\n   , has sent an urgent request to kingdoms far and wide looking for heroes who match the description of the Tri Force Heroes, hoping that they can save his daughter and put a stop to the witch. Link is drafted into the kingdom\\'s Witch-Hunting Brigade, and is paired with two other\\n   \\n    Links\\n   \\n   as they venture forth into the\\n   \\n    Drablands\\n   \\n   , the witch\\'s domain. The other Links are of unclear origin.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   The events of\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   begin with Link, a\\n   Knight of Hyrule\\n   , awakening from a deep sleep in the\\n   Shrine of Resurrection\\n   . He is guided by a mysterious voice to take the\\n   Sheikah Slate\\n   and embark to the outside world, told that he must \"shine upon Hyrule once again.\"\\n   He then exits the Shrine and is free to explore Hyrule. Outside the Shrine, he finds an\\n   \\n    Old Man\\n   \\n   who later informs him that the\\n   \\n    Calamity Ganon\\n   \\n   was a source of many evils 100 years ago, until it was sealed in Hyrule Castle, which has been able to contain it for the past century. The Old Man also mentions that the Calamity Ganon is close to breaking free, giving Link the task to save Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n   Link can choose to go to each of the four\\n   \\n    Ancient Shrines\\n   \\n   on the\\n   \\n    Great Plateau\\n   \\n   and acquire a\\n   Rune\\n   at each one that will grant him special abilities for the Sheikah Slate.\\n  \\n\\n   Link is afflicted by amnesia, as he is unable to remember anyone or anything from prior to his rest in the Shrine of Resurrection.\\n  \\n\\n   Link\\'s father was also a Knight of Hyrule,\\n   though his family was not nobility.\\n   It is rumored that his hometown may have been\\n   Hateno Village\\n   , and as he was from the countryside, his promotion to both Champion and the personal bodyguard of the princess made some nobles unhappy.\\n   According to\\n   Mipha\\'s Diary\\n   , when Link was only four years old he traveled to\\n   \\n    Zora\\'s Domain\\n   \\n   with a group of Hylians on order from\\n   \\n    King Rhoam\\n   \\n   . Even though he was so young, he was already an exceptional swordsman. Mipha describes him as being curious and full of energy at this age, but also reckless.\\n   By the time Link had grown older and obtained the Master Sword, he was much quieter and outwardly colder, though Mipha could tell that inside he was still the same kind person.\\n   The reason for Link maintaining silence through much of the game is explained in\\n   Zelda\\'s Diary\\n   , which states that it is because, with so much at stake, he finds it necessary to be strong and silently bear his burdens, which caused him to stop showing outward emotions.\\n   After awakening from the Shrine of Resurrection without his memories, Link is much more expressive and lighthearted as he does not remember the burdens and expectations that made him stay silent in the past.\\n  \\n\\n   Apparently, he is something of a glutton, and greatly enjoys a good meal.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Sequel to\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Link\\n   \\n   is set to appear in Sequel to\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   . He wears a modified\\n   Champion\\'s Tunic\\n   , and accompanies\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   underground. A character greatly resembling\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   is also seen traversing floating islands in the sky.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Personality\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Because Link bears the Spirit of the Hero,\\n    all of Link\\'s incarnations each possess an unbreakable spirit.\\n    One feature in Link\\'s personality that is greatly emphasized is his courage. He is often depicted as a humble yet brave and courageous boy who steps up to the task of saving the kingdom of Hyrule (and many others),\\n    a task to which he seems destined.\\n    As such, he is often associated with the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Courage\\n   \\n   and the goddess\\n   Farore\\n   : in\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   , the Triforce of Courage activated when Link stepped into the\\n   \\n    Twilight\\n   \\n   , and it protected him from becoming a lost soul, turning him into a\\n   \\n    wolf\\n   \\n   instead.  He rarely shows signs of cowardice and is always willing to use his strength and valor to save and help those around him, as seen in\\n   \\n    The Wind Waker\\n   \\n   where he asks\\n   \\n    Tetra\\n   \\n   and her\\n   \\n    pirate crew\\n   \\n   to allow him to go with them on their\\n   ship\\n   in order to save his sister\\n   \\n    Aryll\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Abilities\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Link is depicted throughout the series as an impressive swordsman. He usually begins his adventure as an average boy with little to no swordsmanship skills. When trouble arises, however, Link demonstrates a natural aptitude for the ways of the sword and is able to best his enemies easily: in\\n   \\n    The Wind Waker\\n   \\n   , Link goes to\\n   Orca\\n   to learn how to wield a sword in order to help Tetra from the\\n   Forest of Fairies\\n   .\\n    It is further noted by Orca himself that Link\\'s ability to use a sword is firmly present in his veins.\\n    As the game progresses, Link becomes known for his swordsmanship as well as his ability to quickly adapt to a wide variety of items and skillfully wield them, such as the\\n   \\n    Boomerang\\n   \\n   , the\\n   \\n    Bow\\n   \\n   , and the\\n   Grappling Hook\\n   , among others.\\n  \\n\\n   In some games, Link can learn advanced sword techniques and complicated move-sets: in\\n   \\n\\n     The Minish Cap\\n    \\n\\n   , the\\n   Blade Brothers\\n   teach the young hero various sword skills by using\\n   Tiger Scrolls\\n   , and in\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   , the\\n   Hero\\'s Spirit\\n   shares his knowledge of the sword by teaching Link seven\\n   Hidden Skills\\n   to help him become more powerful and save Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n   Additionally, Link is portrayed as having an excellent physical condition, performing backflips easily as well as being able to best others in sumo-wrestling, as seen in\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   . However, despite this, Link is usually defenseless without a sword or an item. This is depicted in\\n   \\n    The Wind Waker\\n   \\n   , where Link loses his sword after being launched into the\\n   \\n    Forsaken Fortress\\n   \\n   and must use his stealth abilities to get it back: if he is spotted by an enemy, he quickly surrenders due to his inability to fight back.\\n    Although in some games Link is easily able to pick up large stones or push blocks many times his size, other games require him to use special bracelets or gauntlets to further increase his strength, such as the Power Bracelet or the\\n   Titan\\'s Mitt\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   As seen in\\n   \\n    The Adventure of Link\\n   \\n   ,\\n   \\n    A Link to the Past\\n   \\n   , and\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   , Link is capable of using magic spells such as\\n   Din\\'s Fire\\n   provided that he possesses a\\n   Magic Meter\\n   , which is usually granted to him by a\\n   \\n    Great Fairy\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   Link is also talented in playing a wide variety of instruments. This is first shown in the original\\n   \\n\\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n\\n   , in which the young hero plays the\\n   Recorder\\n   to open up secret entrances or transport him to various parts in the overworld. Since then, Link has competently played other instruments such as the\\n   Ocarina\\n   , a\\n   \\n    pan flute\\n   \\n   , a\\n   guitar\\n   , the\\n   drums\\n   , and a\\n   \\n    Harp\\n   \\n   , all of which play a major role in each of the respective games in which they appear. Not only is Link a proficient instrument player: he is also adept in using a\\n   \\n    conductor\\'s baton\\n   \\n   to conduct other players.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Appearances\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Link is also featured in other media, including comics and mangas based on the games, animated shows, and the\\n   \\n\\n     Super Smash Bros.\\n    \\n    series\\n   \\n   . Unlike the games in the main series, Link has actual dialogue in many of these appearances instead of being a silent hero.\\n  \\n\\n   Link has also made several\\n   cameo appearances\\n   in various games and other media.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Heroes of Hyrule\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Besides the iterations of Link that appear in the games, the backstory to some of the games feature additional unnamed heroes of Hyrule who have a similar appearance to Link.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Goddess\\'s Hero\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Skyward Sword\\n   \\n   , it mentions that there was another hero a long time ago, who was\\n   \\n    Hylia\\n   \\n   \\'s chosen hero. It is only known that Her Grace gave the\\n   Sailcloth\\n   to her chosen hero long ago.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Hero from the\\n    \\n     Minish Legend\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   The back story of\\n   \\n    The Minish Cap\\n   \\n   , tells of the\\n   Minish Legend\\n   . In the\\n   \\n    Minish Legend\\n   \\n   , the\\n   Hero of Men\\n   , a hero clad in green clothes but lacking Link\\'s traditional green hat, arose to fight the demons attacking the world. This\\n   \\n    Minish Legend\\n   \\n   is depicted in a series of stained glass windows beneath the\\n   Elemental Sanctuary\\n   . One of the stained glass windows depicts the Hero of Men receiving the\\n   Picori Blade\\n   and the\\n   \\n    Light Force\\n   \\n   from the\\n   Minish\\n   , while in the other, it shows the hero confronting the monsters that were attacking Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Hero of the Four Sword\\n   \\n\\n\\n   The back story of\\n   \\n    Four Swords\\n   \\n   describes how prior to the events of the game, Vaati attacked Hyrule kidnapping young girls. The knights of Hyrule fought bravely against Vaati, but could not defeat him. A lone traveling boy appeared wielding the\\n   \\n    Four Sword\\n   \\n   . The boy\\'s sword split his body into four and they defeated Vaati and sealed him away into the Four Sword.  After defeating Vaati, the boy vanished into the forest, leaving behind his sword. The people of Hyrule built the\\n   Four Sword Sanctuary\\n   protect the Four Sword and its seal on Vaati.\\n  \\n\\n   According to\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Historia\\n    \\n\\n   , this hero is known as the Hero of the Four Sword and is not the same hero who appears in\\n   \\n    The Minish Cap\\n   \\n   or\\n   \\n    Four Swords\\n   \\n   , but is another hero who appears in between the two games.\\n   \\n    Hyrule Historia\\n   \\n   describes him as someone about whom little is known, but he appears to be the descendant of the hero who previously defeated Vaati in\\n   \\n    The Minish Cap\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The Hero 10,000 Years Prior to\\n    \\n\\n      Breath of the Wild\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   10,000 years before the events of\\n   \\n\\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n   , an incarnation of the Hero united with an incarnation of the Princess, the four\\n   \\n    Divine Beasts\\n   \\n   and numerous\\n   Guardians\\n   to seal\\n   \\n    Calamity Ganon\\n   \\n   away beneath Hyrule Castle.\\n    This legend is told in the prologue and retold to Link separately by\\n   \\n    Impa\\n   \\n   and\\n   Kass\\n   . This version of the Hero is never seen directly, but appears in artistic form on an ancient tapestry design. The artwork depicts him with green eyes, fiery red hair and wearing a light blue\\n   Champion\\'s Tunic\\n   like the one his successor wears in the distant future.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Ambiguously Canon Content\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Hero of Light\\n    \\n\\n\\n    In\\n    \\n\\n      Ancient Stone Tablets\\n     \\n\\n    , a game for the\\n    \\n     Satellaview\\n    \\n    , the\\n    avatar characters\\n    of the BS-X replace Link as the central heroes, who could be male or female depending on the player\\'s settings, and become known as the\\n    Hero of Light\\n    . Six years after the events of\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    and during Link\\'s absence, Hyrule\\'s long peace comes to a sudden end as Princess Zelda suffers from reoccurring dreams of evil to come. She and\\n    Aginah\\n    then witness a flash of light in the forest and upon arriving to investigate, find an unconscious youth and bring them to rest at Sahasrahla\\'s old hideaway. Zelda senses that the youth may be endowed with the power of courage, and believes that they may be the Hero of Light.\\n   \\n\\n    The young hero was then given the task to locate several stone tablets and eventually learns that though Link had defeated Ganon previously in the last game, his spirit had lived on through his malice. Ganon had learned of and coveted the power of the Hero of Light, and had subsequently managed to summon the hero into Hyrule, hoping to obtain the hero\\'s power to be fully reborn. Once Ganon was defeated, the Hero of Light returned the Master Sword they had used to its pedestal and returned to where they had come from in a flash of light.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Age\\n   \\n\\n\\n   During an Iwata Asks for\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time 3D\\n   \\n   , Shigeru Miyamoto stated that Link is about 12 in\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   ;\\n    however, according to\\n   \\n    Hyrule Historia\\n   \\n   , Link is 10.\\n    As stated in The Official Nintendo Player\\'s Guide,\\n   \\n    Hyrule Historia\\n   \\n   ,\\n    and by Shigeru Miyamoto during the Iwata Asks for\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time 3D\\n   \\n   ,\\n    Link is 16 in\\n   \\n    The Adventure of Link\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   In the same Iwata Asks, Miyamoto stated that in\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   , Link is 9 as a child and 16 as an adult;\\n    however,\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time — Official Nintendo Player\\'s Guide\\n   \\n   by\\n   Nintendo Power\\n   states that he is 10 as a child.\\n    According to the\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   Link\\n   \\n    amiibo\\n   \\n   description, he is 17 as an adult.\\n  \\n\\n   At the start of\\n   \\n    The Wind Waker\\n   \\n   , Link is given the\\n   \\n    Hero\\'s Clothes\\n   \\n   to wear on his birthday, which are to be worn by the boys of\\n   Outset Island\\n   upon reaching the same age as the Hero of Time when he set out on his journey.\\n    Taking into account the age of the Hero of Time revealed in the Iwata Asks interview, the Hero of Winds would be around 9 years old when he sets out on his journey; however,\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker — The Official Nintendo Player\\'s Guide\\n   \\n   by\\n   Nintendo Power\\n   ,\\n   Zelda Box\\n   ,\\n   \\n\\n     Encyclopedia\\n    \\n\\n   ,\\n    the Toon Link\\n   \\n    Trophy\\n   \\n   in\\n   \\n\\n     Super Smash Bros.

Dark Link is more than just a mere battle against a monster for Link, but a battle against himself, as the young hero has to face his own strength turned against him.\\n   Due to this, Dark Link is often the ultimate challenge, and is faced as a final boss on one occasion and as the final boss of optional challenges such as the\\n   Palace of the Four Sword\\n   and\\n   Take \\'Em All On!\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Contents\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       1\\n      \\n\\n       Characteristics\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         1.1\\n        \\n\\n\\n          A Link to the Past\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         1.2\\n        \\n\\n\\n          Ocarina of Time\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         1.3\\n        \\n\\n\\n          Oracle of Ages\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         1.4\\n        \\n\\n\\n          Twilight Princess\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         1.5\\n        \\n\\n\\n          Spirit Tracks\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         1.6\\n        \\n\\n\\n          Breath of the Wild\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       2\\n      \\n\\n       Other Appearances\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         2.1\\n        \\n\\n\\n          Super Smash Bros.

He wears the same clothing as Link: a tunic and a long, floppy cap, though the similarities to Link end there. His entire outfit is black or dark gray instead of green. Moreover, his hair is usually either a shadowy black or a dark gray. Dark Link tends to be left-handed, like Link. However, in some appearances (particularly when multiple copies of him appear), he has been shown to favor either hand. Another notable feature is his red eyes, which are usually the only prominent feature against his dark visage.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In the\\n   Game Boy Advance\\n   port of\\n   \\n\\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n\\n   , after completing both the main story of\\n   \\n    A Link to the Past\\n   \\n   and the multiplayer\\n   \\n    Four Swords\\n   \\n   game, the\\n   Palace of the Four Sword\\n   is unlocked. The Dungeon Master is four Dark Links, each with a unique\\n   tunic\\n   , corresponding to the colors of the\\n   Links\\n   that hold the\\n   Four Sword\\n   . Reaching the final room of the dungeon causes the four different colored\\n   Four Swords\\n   to rise into the air, and following this the Dark Links will drop from above. Each Dark Link has slightly different abilities, but they all aggressively attack with sword swipes and do not open their defenses often. They are quite agile, able to leap backwards out of the way of Link\\'s attacks. They are fought one at a time, and they get progressively more difficult. The green Dark Link uses the\\n   Pegasus Boots\\n   to suddenly dash at Link; the red Dark Link uses the\\n   Hurricane Spin\\n   and the Pegasus Boots. The blue Dark Link also uses Pegasus Boots and the Hurricane Spin, and he can leap into the air to perform a\\n   Down Thrust\\n   (this is also similar to Link\\'s use of the\\n   Quake Medallion\\n   ). The purple Dark Link is the final Dark Link, and utilizes the Pegasus Boots, Hurricane Spin, Down Thrust, and the\\n   Sword Beam\\n   . Defeating each Dark Link will break the curse on the Four Sword and return it to normal.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   , Dark Link appears as a\\n   Sub-Boss\\n   in the\\n   Water Temple\\n   , where he materializes from Link\\'s reflection in the water to confront his counterpart. Dark Link reacts to most of Link\\'s movements and attacks, usually defending himself in the process.\\n   Dark Link has the same amount of health as Link; the number of\\n   \\n    Heart Containers\\n   \\n   the hero has equals the number of hits with the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   it takes to defeat his doppelgänger. When hit, Dark Link will fall through the floor and spring back up afterwards. At the beginning of the battle, Dark Link is nearly transparent, but will gradually become opaque as the battle progresses. When he is fully opaque, he will become more aggressive and actively attack Link instead of simply reacting to his moves.\\n  \\n\\n   There are a variety of strategies for defeating Dark Link. Link can use the\\n   Megaton Hammer\\n   ,\\n   \\n    Deku Nuts\\n   \\n   ,\\n   Biggoron Sword\\n   , or use his\\n   \\n    sword\\n   \\n   while L/Z targeting him and performing a horizontal slash on the opposite side of his\\n   \\n    shield\\n   \\n   , which gives Link an instant hit. Stocking up on magic\\n   \\n    Potions\\n   \\n   and using\\n   Din\\'s Fire\\n   is another option that makes the fight against Dark Link very easy. Din\\'s Fire is one of the best options in both the passive and aggressive part of the battle, as it will cause damage every time, provided that Dark Link is in range. If Link performs a sword thrust, Dark Link will simply hop onto the blade of the sword (before attacking if aggressive). Once Dark Link is defeated, Link becomes able to enter a room containing the\\n   Longshot\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   Dark Link shares Link\\'s voice, but it is heavily distorted, giving it a demonic feel.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Oracle of Ages\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   During the second phase of the final battle,\\n   Veran\\n   creates four clones of Dark Link that mimic Link\\'s movement in reverse and act as dangerous obstacles. Unlike other appearances of Dark Link, these clones do not attack, and are useful in recovering health, as they are easily destroyed and drop one\\n   \\n    Heart\\n   \\n   each. They are similar in behavior to\\n   Arm-Mimics\\n   and\\n   Mask-Mimics\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Dark Link\\n   \\n   makes a cameo appearance during a cutscene in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   that tells the tale of how the\\n   Twili\\n   race was banished to the\\n   Twilight Realm\\n   . Portraying the powerful\\n   Dark Interlopers\\n   who sought to control the\\n   Sacred Realm\\n   , three clones of\\n   \\n    Dark Link\\n   \\n   manage to destroy Link (portraying a common citizen) before they are banished to the\\n   \\n    Twilight Realm\\n   \\n   by the\\n   \\n\\n     Light Spirits\\n    \\n\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Spirit Tracks\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Dark Link appears as the final challenge of the\\n   Take \\'Em All On!\\n   mini-game in\\n   \\n    Castle Town\\n   \\n   . In this appearance, he attacks using a blade as dark as himself, that subsequently leaves a fitting black trail, and he can also place\\n   \\n    bombs\\n   \\n   and shoot arrows. He can also perform a jump attack like Link, only his is higher and much slower. Dark Link also mimics Link\\'s sword attacks when he himself is not attacking, so Link must block his attacks and then counterattack. The music played when fighting him is the same as the track used when\\n   Link\\n   chased the\\n   Ghost Ship\\n   during the final boss\\'s second phase in\\n   \\n\\n     Phantom Hourglass\\n    \\n\\n   . Conversely to his appearance in\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   , he slowly fades from a pure black to a translucent gray as he takes damage, and once defeated, he falls over on his back and disappears, his eyes eerily left open during the whole animation. The room he is fought in is the only one which contains\\n   \\n    Hearts\\n   \\n   , despite Joynas\\'s earlier warning that there is no way to recover health in the challenge rooms.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   , the\\n   Dark Series\\n   is an\\n   Armor Set\\n   that gives Link the appearance of Dark Link, as he appeared in\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   . Wearing the full Set grants Link the\\n   \\n    Night Speed Up\\n   \\n   Set Bonus\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Appearances\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Non-Canon Information\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Super Smash Bros.

Brawl\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    Both Link and\\n    \\n     Toon Link\\n    \\n    are able to take on the appearance of Dark Link as an alternate costume in\\n    \\n\\n      Super Smash Bros. Brawl\\n     \\n\\n    . This version mostly resembles the one featured in the\\n    \\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n    cutscene.\\n   \\n\\n\\n     Super Smash Bros. Melee\\'\\n    \\n    s version of Dark Link (which in turn is based on the Dark Link from\\n    \\n     The Adventure of Link\\n    \\n    and\\n    \\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n    , with a completely black appearance) reappears in the event match \"\\n    \\n     Dark Link Duel\\n    \\n    \" on the\\n    \\n     Bridge of Eldin\\n    \\n    stage. Unlike the alternate costume, the Dark Link in this event is completely black, as opposed to Link\\'s alternate costume, which is mostly gray and black with red eyes. As in\\n    \\n     Super Smash Bros. Melee\\n    \\n    , Link is the only option to fight against Dark Link. However, unlike\\n    \\n     Super Smash Bros. Melee\\n    \\n    , this battle is fought as a Stamina match, making him more like a traditional\\n    \\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n    enemy. A similar event, known as\\n    \\n     Battle of the Dark Sides\\n    \\n    , is featured for two players, in which Dark Link is fought by Link and Samus together, but is similarly accompanied by Dark Samus, an entity that, like Dark Link, is completely black, instead of resembling the canon\\n    \\n     Metroid\\n    \\n    character of the same name.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n      Ocarina of Time\\n     \\n     (Himekawa)\\n    \\n\\n\\n    In the\\n    \\n\\n      Ocarina of Time\\n     \\n     manga\\n    \\n    by\\n    Akira Himekawa\\n    , Link meets up with his shadowed doppelganger at\\n    Kakariko Village\\n    . From\\n    Beneath the Well\\n    , Dark Link emerges, ready to defeat the original Link. The original Link managed to defeat his dark self by learning that the shadow monster is only as good as Link was then. So to defeat him, Link had to become better than he was before. Slicing Dark Link in half, the dark hero was not yet done. Dark Link then returned riding on a Dark Epona. Link countered and defeated Dark Link once again with the use of his own\\n    \\n     Epona\\n    \\n    . This Dark Link replaced\\n    Bongo Bongo\\n    as boss, most likely because the\\n    Shadow Temple\\n    didn\\'t appear in the manga.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n      Hyrule Warriors\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    In\\n    \\n\\n      Hyrule Warriors\\n     \\n\\n    , Dark Link appears as a mini-boss in the \"\\n    A War of Spirit\\n    \"\\n    Scenario\\n    . He is summoned by\\n    Cia\\n    by channeling the darker side of Link\\'s personality into physical form, appearing as a completely dark version of him with glowing red eyes. After the first one is defeated, several more copies are summoned which attack Link and the\\n    Hyrulean Forces\\n    . Link fights them all with the confidence that he can easily overcome them, but quickly becomes overwhelmed, and is saved by his allies who defeat and dispel the Dark Links.\\n   \\n\\n    In the\\n    \\n     Master Quest\\n    \\n    DLC pack, Dark Link appears again in the\\n    Cia\\'s Tale\\n    Scenario, \"\\n    Darkness Falls\\n    \". When Cia\\'s dark magic begins to steadily unhinge her mind, she begins summoning several Dark Links to defend herself from Ganondorf\\'s Forces, under the delusion that Link will come to protect her. However, by the time Zelda\\'s Forces reach her stronghold, the Dark Links appeared to have all been vanquished in battle.\\n   \\n\\n    In\\n    \\n     Hyrule Warriors Legends\\n    \\n    amd\\n    \\n     Hyrule Warriors:\\xa0Definitive Edition\\n    \\n    , the Dark Links make one final appearance in the\\n    Wind Waker\\n    Scenario, \"\\n    Reclaiming the Darkness\\n    \". They are summoned forth by Dark Cia to capture the real Cia. However, they and Dark Cia are once more vanquished by Link and his allies.\\n   \\n\\n    Two of Cia\\'s combo attacks with the\\n    Scepter\\n    involve summoning a circle of Dark Links around her to take out nearby enemies.\\n   \\n\\n    A Dark Link\\n    Costume\\n    is also available to use when playing as Link for players who buy the\\n    \\n     Hero of Hyrule\\n    \\n    DLC season pass, or by purchasing all of the packs included in it. The Costume will also turn Link\\'s Weapons into the same color scheme;\\n    \\n     Epona\\n    \\n    and the\\n    Great Fairy\\n    will change color and have glowing red eyes. As Dark Link was spawned from Link\\'s shadow, he himself does not cast one.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n      Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    Link and Toon Link return their Dark Link costumes in\\n    \\n\\n      Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U\\n     \\n\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n      Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    Link, Toon Link and also\\n    Young Link\\n    can take on the appearance of Dark Link as alternate costumes in\\n    \\n\\n      Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\\n     \\n\\n    . While Link is based on his\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n    appearance, Link\\'s costume does not resemble the\\n    Dark Series\\n    , instead giving Link dark gray skin and glowing red eyes while wearing a black\\n    Wild Set\\n    . Young Link\\'s costume also gives him dark gray skin and glowing red eyes while wearing a black\\n    Kokiri Tunic\\n    and black\\n    Kokiri Boots\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n      Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    As in\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n    , Link can don the Dark Armor set to take on the guise of the Hero of Time\\'s incarnation of Dark Link, though its pieces are obtained in separate challenge missions. The Dark Hood is obtained in Questionable Escort Mission, the Dark Trousers in Fire Hazards and the Dark Tunic in Unnatural Disaster. Unlike in\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n    , the costume is merely cosmetic and does not provide any bonuses when wearing the full set.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Trivia\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    In his appearance in\\n    \\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n    , Dark Link appears next to a dead, blackened tree. This may serve as a contrast to the living green trees that surrounded Link in his youth, and to emphasize the light/dark scenario.\\n    \\n\\n      Upon passing the dead tree, Link\\'s shadow disappears before Dark Link materializes, suggesting that Dark Link is his shadow.\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    Dark Link in\\n    \\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n    can be made to imitate most of Link\\'s animations. Stunning Dark Link with Deku Nuts in a specific way will cause him to mirror Link\\'s every move. This can be used to a comical effect; for example, if Link is down to a fraction of a heart and leans over panting, Dark Link will also act fatigued. Dark Link also mimics Link\\'s idle animations, such as checking his sword and tunic. If Link puts on the Iron Boots, Dark Link will start moving as if he were also wearing them.\\n    \\n\\n      In\\n      \\n\\n        Ocarina of Time 3D\\n       \\n\\n      , Dark Link will instead slide towards Link on one leg, frozen in a single frame of his running animation.\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n    Dark Link\\'s model in\\n    \\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n    appears to be a more simplified version of Link\\'s with some minor differences as he lacks ears, his tunic is more \"skintight\" and lacks gauntlets. Additionally, his sword and shield are part of his limbs.\\n   \\n\\n    In\\n    \\n     Ocarina of Time 3D\\n    \\n    , Dark Link is detailed and textured, granting him an appearance similar to the\\n    \\n     Dark Interlopers\\n    \\n    visual aides. When defeated, he now makes the same sound effect that Link normally makes when knocked to the ground.\\n   \\n\\n    In\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    , the GBA-exclusive Dark Links have the same sword and shield that Link currently has equipped, but they will always inflict the same amount of damage. If Link does not have any shield, his dark counterparts will have the Fighter\\'s Shield.\\n   \\n\\n    In\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n    , a Dark Link\\n    \\n     Armor\\n    \\n    Set is available for purchase at\\n    Kilton\\n    \\'s\\n    Fang and Bone\\n    shop after completing all four\\n    Divine Beasts\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Names in Other Regions\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Language\\n     \\n\\n      Name\\n     \\n\\n      Meaning\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Japanese\\n     \\n\\n      ダークリンク\\xa0(\\n      \\n       Dāku Rinku\\n      \\n      )\\n     \\n\\n      Same as English.\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      French\\n     \\n\\n      Link noir\\n     \\n\\n      Black Link\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       This table was generated using\\n       .\\n       To request an addition, please\\n       a\\n       staff member\\n       with a\\n       \\n        reference\\n       \\n       .\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Malon then says that Epona has taken a liking to him.\\n  \\n\\n   Link then finds Epona seven years later when she has become a mare. However, things have taken a turn at the Ranch and\\n   Ingo\\n   is now in charge. Ingo plans to present Epona to\\n   Ganondorf\\n   ,\\n   who he claims gave him ownership of the Ranch.\\n   At first, Epona will run from Link as if he is a stranger, but if he plays \"Epona\\'s Song\", she will remember him and trot to his side. Link can then participate in a horse race against Ingo with Epona as his steed. If Link wins, Ingo will get furious, challenging him again while betting Epona herself on the outcome of the race.\\n   If Link wins, Ingo lets him keep Epona. However, Ingo then attempts to prevent Link from leaving with Epona by shutting the gates of the Ranch.\\n   Link can guide Epona to jump over the walls of the Ranch to escape into\\n   \\n    Hyrule Field\\n   \\n   . Afterwards, Link can play \"Epona\\'s Song\" while in Hyrule Field to call her. During the ending credits, Epona is seen running across Hyrule Field, and is later seen next to Malon during the celebration of Ganondorf\\'s defeat at Lon Lon Ranch.\\n  \\n\\n   While riding Epona, Link cannot get hurt by enemies and can only attack by using the\\n   Bow\\n   . He can also whip her to get up to six speed boosts, appearing on-screen as\\n   Carrots\\n   . The boosts can be used to jump over barriers and fences, such as in the aforementioned escape from Lon Lon Ranch after Ingo shuts the gates, and are restored after a few seconds. Epona can be used to jump across the broken bridge in\\n   Gerudo Valley\\n   and to play the\\n   Horseback Archery Range\\n   minigame in\\n   \\n    Gerudo\\'s Fortress\\n   \\n   . She is also required to summon\\n   Big Poes\\n   in Hyrule Field. Despite this, obtaining Epona is entirely optional, as Link can also cross the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley using the\\n   Longshot\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Majora\\'s Mask\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Link is first seen riding Epona through the\\n   \\n    Lost Woods\\n   \\n   at the start of\\n   \\n\\n     Majora\\'s Mask\\n    \\n\\n   . Epona is then startled by\\n   Tatl\\n   and\\n   Tael\\n   , causing\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   to be thrown to the ground and knocked unconscious. The\\n   Skull Kid\\n   wearing\\n   Majora\\'s Mask\\n   then appears and searches Link\\'s body, finding the\\n   Ocarina of Time\\n   and taking it.\\n   When Link regains consciousness, the Skull Kid attempts to hide the Ocarina, but Link lunges at him in an attempt to get it back. The Skull Kid then leaps out of the way and onto Epona, galloping away on her afterwards. Link leaps after him but only manages to grab onto Skull Kid\\'s leg. Epona continues to gallop along, dragging Link with them until he loses his grip. When Link finally catches up with the Skull Kid again, he tells him that he got rid of Epona because she did not listen to a word he said.\\n  \\n\\n   After completing the\\n   Snowhead Temple\\n   , Link finds Epona in\\n   Romani Ranch\\n   . If he visits the Ranch on the\\n   First Day\\n   ,\\n   Romani\\n   teaches him \"Epona\\'s Song\" and gives Epona back to Link after he practices shooting balloons while riding her.\\n   Epona is required to enter the\\n   Great Bay\\n   and\\n   Ikana Canyon\\n   since they are blocked by fences that only she can jump over. During the\\n   ending credits\\n   , Link is seen departing from\\n   Termina\\n   on Epona.\\n  \\n\\n   As in\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   , enemies cannot hurt Link while riding on Epona, he can only attack by using his Bow, and he can get up to six speed boosts.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     The Minish Cap\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Epona can be seen in\\n   Hyrule Town\\n   carrying a wagon with\\n   Milk\\n   containers in\\n   \\n\\n     The Minish Cap\\n    \\n\\n   . She is owned by Malon, who sells milk to Link after he helps her and\\n   Talon\\n   find the\\n   Spare Key\\n   to their farm house. While\\n   Minish\\n   -sized,\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   can communicate with Epona, who asks him to buy some Lon Lon Milk.\\n   Link can also\\n   Fuse\\n   Kinstones\\n   with her.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   The name of Link\\'s horse can be chosen in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   , although the default name is Epona. She is seen and used very early in the game, aiding Link in his job as a rancher in\\n   Ordon Village\\n   , although\\n   Ilia\\n   is the one who takes care of her.\\n   Ilia gets angry when Link treats the horse poorly or she gets hurt.\\n   After the village is attacked by\\n   King Bulblin\\n   , Epona disappears. However, Link reunites with her later in\\n   Kakariko Village\\n   , where she runs around desperately attempting to throw off two\\n   Bulblins\\n   . Once the Bulblins are defeated, Link has to tame her and then ride her back to Ordon Village to ask\\n   \\n    Mayor Bo\\n   \\n   how to best the\\n   Gorons\\n   of\\n   \\n    Death Mountain\\n   \\n   .\\n   After returning to Kakariko Village, Link and Epona ride together to save\\n   Colin\\n   after he is kidnapped and taken into Hyrule Field by King Bulblin.\\n  \\n\\n   In most locations around Hyrule Field, Link can call Epona by blowing a\\n   Horse Grass\\n   or the\\n   Horse Call\\n   , which both play \"Epona\\'s Song\". Unlike in previous games, Link can use various items while riding her, including the\\n   \\n    Sword\\n   \\n   . Additionally, Epona can provide short speed boosts like in\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   and\\n   \\n    Majora\\'s Mask\\n   \\n   , appearing onscreen as spurs instead of Carrots. Epona is used when fighting against\\n   King Bulblin\\n   and during the third part of the final battle with Ganondorf.\\n   Wolf Link\\n   is able to speak with her, as with other animals.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Link can obtain Epona in\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   by scanning either the\\n   \\n    Super Smash Bros.\\n   \\n   Link or\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   Zelda 30th Anniversary Link\\n   amiibo\\n   . Unlike other horses in the game, Epona does not need to be tamed and can be immediately mounted. Once registered at a\\n   Stable\\n   , Epona cannot be obtained more than once through the amiibo, even if deceased as she can be revived by\\n   Malanya\\n   if she is registered when she dies.\\n  \\n\\n   Like the\\n   Giant Horse\\n   , her mane cannot be groomed and she receives a special bridle and saddle called Epona Gear.\\n  \\n\\n   Though not stated in-game, Epona is the namesake of\\n   \\n    Epona Co.\\n   \\n   , a 150 year old company that makes horse goods from horse gear to fine items like brushes and riding wear worn by stable workers.\\n   Their company logo can be seen on the hats of Stable workers and the base of the\\n   Horse\\n   statue at the\\n   Sanidin Park Ruins\\n   indicating they were involved in its construction. As a result, Epona is famous and legendary horse among the stable managers/innkeepers as they recognize her when Link registers her and will force Link to name her Epona as they will not accept any other name.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Appearances\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Ambiguously Canon Content\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Link\\'s Crossbow Training\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Super Smash Bros.

The developers did not want controls to be difficult, so Epona was made to automatically jump over barriers if she has enough speed. To make the experience more entertaining, the carrot system was established, as well as mounted archery. The developers also wanted to include one-on-one battles and horseback swordplay, though such features did not appear until\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   The scene where Epona jumps over the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley was specially requested by\\n   \\n    Shigeru Miyamoto\\n   \\n   . A similar scene is shown when Epona escapes from Lon Lon Ranch, which had more than one exit, so a cutscene was made for each. The idea of horses and these scenes were inspired by Western movies.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Trivia\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Various unnamed horses resembling Epona appear in the opening cinematics of\\n    \\n\\n      Oracle of Seasons\\n     \\n\\n    ,\\n    \\n\\n      Oracle of Ages\\n     \\n\\n    , and\\n    \\n     The Wind Waker\\n    \\n    , as well as in\\n    The Field\\n    stage from\\n    \\n\\n      Four Swords Adventures\\n     \\n\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    During development of\\n    \\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n    , Link would use a whip to control Epona.

There are many Shadow Links; the Dark Mirror can create an endless supply from\\n   Ganondorf\\n   \\'s resentment and evil thoughts from his defeat in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   ,\\n   but they all work together as one. He first appears early in the game in the\\n   Four Sword Sanctuary\\n   and tricks Link into drawing the Four Sword, releasing the ancient Wind Mage\\n   \\n    Vaati\\n   \\n   and splitting Link into four Links. He and his copies then plague Hyrule by terrorizing its citizens, some of whom blame the Links for their misdeeds. Shadow Links usually show up repeatedly in each stage, often causing mischief using a certain item, such as setting fires with the\\n   Fire Rod\\n   , creating stunning shockwaves with the\\n   Hammer\\n   , or charging at the\\n   \\n    Links\\n   \\n   with the\\n   Pegasus Boots\\n   . Sometimes they will simply taunt the Links by hopping in place and jumping away when they get too close. Defeating a Shadow Link will yield a large green\\n   \\n    Force Gem\\n   \\n   , but they will flee to the\\n   Dark World\\n   if they are not defeated in time or if they evade the Links enough times.\\n  \\n\\n   Shadow Link will also sometimes appear and summon a\\n   Big Bomb\\n   . When this Bomb explodes, all Links on screen will be instantly defeated if they do not take shelter or leave the area before the countdown reaches zero. He will continue to summon an endless supply of Big Bombs until the Links progress through the area.\\n  \\n\\n   Shadow Link appears as the main boss in the\\n   Cave of No Return\\n   ,\\n   Village of the Blue Maiden\\n   ,\\n   Desert Temple\\n   , and\\n   The Dark Cloud\\n   stages. He will also appear as a\\n   Sub-Boss\\n   for the\\n   Mountain Path\\n   ,\\n   Tower of Flames\\n   ,\\n   Kakariko Village\\n   ,\\n   Desert of Doubt\\n   and\\n   Temple of Ice\\n   stages. During each battle, except for the Dark Cloud stage, Shadow Link will eventually take on a random color, and only the corresponding Link can damage him. During these battles Shadow Link usually travels back and forth from the Dark World and attacks Link with his copy of the Four Sword. Shadow Link and his kin are finally defeated once and for all in The Dark Cloud stage when, while the Links engage them in combat,\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   undoes the seal on the Dark Mirror and takes it into her possession, dispelling them. Shadow Link also appears as a mini boss on other stages.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Shadow Battle\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In the additional multiplayer game in\\n   \\n    Four Swords Adventures\\n   \\n   known as\\n   Shadow Battle\\n   , four colored Shadow Links battle for supremacy in a number of different arenas. While appearing identical to the four Links of the normal game, they appear in the same manner as Shadow Link and have his voice at the start of battle. During these battles, Shadow Link has the exact same abilities as Link normally would.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     A Link Between Worlds\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Shadow Links appear in\\n   \\n\\n     A Link Between Worlds\\n    \\n\\n   , but they do not play a part in the main story and have no known connection to the Dark Mirror or Ganondorf. Once Link has spoken to\\n   Gramps\\n   and activated StreetPass, and the player has received a StreetPass Hit on their\\n   3DS\\n   system, a Shadow Link representing another player\\'s Link will appear waiting in one of various locations around\\n   \\n    Hyrule\\n   \\n   or\\n   Lorule\\n   , and a sign will appear in Gramps\\' field offering a hint to his location. It will speak to Link and challenge him to battle. Accepting this challenge will cause Link and Shadow Link to be transported to a battle arena where they will fight in a\\n   Shadow Link Battle\\n   . In this mode of the game, a remix of the\\n   Palace\\n   Theme from\\n   \\n\\n     The Adventure of Link\\n    \\n\\n   plays as a homage to\\n   Link\\'s Shadow\\n   . Shadow Link is only a representation of the other player, and is controlled by the computer. Its items and gear are determined by those set by the other player when talking to\\n   Gramps\\n   . The combined might of the items held by Shadow Link adds up to a bounty of\\n   \\n    Rupees\\n   \\n   that can be won once Link defeats it, and a number of Challenges can be attempted, such as defeating Shadow Link using a specific Item. The player does not have to pass another person to receive a Shadow Link, as occasionally Shadow Links from a mysterious player named Shade will appear.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Tri Force Heroes\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   Three Shadow Links appear as the bosses of the Baneful Zone in the\\n   Den of Trials\\n   in\\n   \\n    Tri Force Heroes\\n   \\n   . They wield powerful versions of the items that appear in the game, in addition to Swords which will temporarily\\n   Curse\\n   Link upon dealing damage. Their items are chosen randomly, thus requiring a different strategy every time the Shadow Links are fought. They will each aggressively pursue the Links as they attack. However, ranged weapons are very useful in this battle. Each Shadow Link drops a\\n   \\n    Heart\\n   \\n   when defeated. Once they have all been defeated, a Triforce Gateway will appear leading to the Baneful Zone\\'s and Den of Trials\\' final floor. On this floor, there are three\\n   \\n    Treasure Chests\\n   \\n   to choose from containing Silver-rarity\\n   \\n    Materials\\n   \\n   from the\\n   Sky Realm\\n   , or; if the entire Den of Trials has been completed from the first floor, there will be eight Chests, each containing a Gold-rarity Material from a different area of the\\n   \\n    Drablands\\n   \\n   . At the bottom of whichever Chest he chooses, Link will find the\\n   Fierce Deity Armor\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Link\\'s Awakening\\n    \\n    for Nintendo Switch\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Link\\'s Awakening\\n    \\n\\n   for Nintendo Switch, by tapping the game\\'s Link\\n    amiibo\\n    after speaking with\\n    Dampé\\n    , Link will be given the\\n    +Shadow Link Effect\\n   Chamber Stone\\n   . If placed while creating a\\n    Chamber Dungeon\\n    , Shadow Link will appear, and will chase and attack Link until one of them is defeated. Once defeated, he will yield various\\n   \\n    Rupees\\n   \\n   and a\\n   \\n    Fairy\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Appearances\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Four Swords\\n    \\n    (Himekawa)\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Non-Canon Information\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    In the\\n    \\n\\n      Four Swords\\n     \\n     manga\\n    \\n    by\\n    \\n     Akira Himekawa\\n    \\n    , Shadow Link was drawn from the\\n    Dark Mirror\\n    by\\n    \\n     Ganon\\n    \\n    to act out his wishes. Shadow Link is a twisted version of Link, born from his own shadow, and is a cruel, malevolent and calculating character. He first appears after causing the\\n     Shrine Maidens\\n     to vanish, and proclaims himself to be \"the hero, Link\". Completely avoiding Link\\'s attack, he immediately kidnaps Zelda and sends Link to the\\n     Four Sword Sanctuary\\n     , from which he observes as Link awakens\\n    \\n     Vaati\\n    \\n    . His next move is to lead Vaati\\'s troops to attack\\n    \\n     Hyrule Castle\\n    \\n    and send all the\\n    \\n     Knights of Hyrule\\n    \\n    to the\\n     Dark World\\n     . There, he confronts the four\\n    \\n     Links\\n    \\n    , revealing himself to be much stronger than they are with their tainted blades, and striking them down with\\n     Sword Beams\\n     . They are saved by the Blue Maiden, who releases a\\n    \\n     Fairy\\n    \\n    to shine light upon him, stunning him long enough for them to escape.\\n   \\n\\n    Shadow Link continues to plot, hidden away from the light. As he cannot go out in daylight, he works with Vaati\\'s minions to thwart the progress of the four Links. Using dark magic, he manages to split the four Links apart by sending them to four different lands of Hyrule, thus weakening the strength of the\\n    \\n     Four Sword\\n    \\n    . Then, confronting Vio, he attempts to coerce him into joining the side of darkness by appealing to his intelligence. Working with Vio, he traps Red and Blue in the\\n    Temple of Darkness\\n    , and allows Vio to be placed in charge of the\\n     Tower of Flames\\n     on\\n    \\n     Death Mountain\\n    \\n    . Vio even appears to kill Green in battle, totally convincing Shadow Link that he has turned to the side of evil.\\n   \\n\\n    However, Vio is simply putting on a show to gain his trust. Once inside, he learns about Ganon and his potential weakness, and the existence of the Dark Mirror, the source of darkness from which Shadow Link was originally summoned. He also learns that Shadow Link does not desire to follow Ganon, and in fact wishes to rule over Hyrule alongside Vio. Shadow Link simply hates humans and the world for spurning him as \"just a shadow\". However, after Vio is foiled in an attempt to shatter the mirror, Shadow Link discovers his betrayal and attempts to execute him in by dropping him into the lava of Death Mountain. Saved at the last minute by the three other Links, they confront Shadow Link, and with their new-found strength, destroy him with a combined Sword Beam attack.\\n   \\n\\n    Shadow Link is not killed, however, and is pulled by Ganon from the mirror again, dripping and shivering as he tries to resist entering the light. Seeing him in this state,\\n    \\n     Princess Zelda\\n    \\n    takes pity upon him. He attempts to spurn her but is momentarily moved by her words as she states that he should not fear the light, as he too is a hero. Driven by a desire to save her from the Dark Cloud, he disguises himself as Vio and aids the three other Links in their battle against\\n    \\n     Vaati\\n    \\n    . Realizing that the demon cannot be killed by the Four Sword alone however, he returns to the Dark Mirror, and in an act of self sacrifice he shatters it, destroying both Vaati and himself in the process. Before he vanishes, the four Links thank him, and tell him he will always be a part of them. Shadow Link makes a final appearance on the penultimate page of the manga, appearing as Link\\'s shadow and giving a thumb\\'s up.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Cadence of Hyrule\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Ambiguously Canon Content\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Shadow Links\\n    \\n    appear as\\n    \\n     Minibosses\\n    \\n    in\\n    \\n     Cadence of Hyrule\\n    \\n    .\\n    \\n     Shadow Link\\n    \\n    is also added as a playable character in the\\n    \\n     Character Pack\\n    \\n    downloadable content pack.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Trivia\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Shadow Link\\'s theme music in\\n    \\n     Four Swords Adventures\\n    \\n    is a remix of the Kakariko Village Soldiers theme from\\n    \\n\\n      A Link to the Past\\n     \\n\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    Shadow Link\\'s voice in\\n    \\n\\n      Four Swords Adventures\\n     \\n\\n    is Link\\'s voice pitched up by around 45% percent, or about +6.43 semitones.\\n   \\n\\n    Shadow Link\\'s theme music in\\n    \\n     A Link Between Worlds\\n    \\n    and\\n    \\n     Tri Force Heroes\\n    \\n    are remixes of the Palace theme and the\\n    Dark Link\\n    Battle theme, respectively, from\\n    \\n\\n      The Adventure of Link\\n     \\n\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    Shadow Link in\\n    \\n     A Link Between Worlds\\n    \\n    is tied with\\n    Gramps\\n    for the highest damage output of any vulnerable\\n    \\n     Enemy\\n    \\n    in the series.
