Ezlo mentions that the Mayfly Fairy's song lasts her entire life, and that the moment she stops singing, she will die. At that moment, the Mayfly Fairy stops singing and begins to fade. Overcome with pity, Link begs her to continue singing so that she may live longer. The Mayfly Fairy comforts him by saying that as long as she had an audience, someone who cared for her, that is all she needs, and she can pass on in peace. Wishing for Link to experience her happiness, she presents Link with the Water Element. At that moment, Vaati appears through the cavern walls after sensing a great energy. After exchanging threats, Vaati instantly recognizes Ezlo and addresses him as \"Master Ezlo\", and asks how he's \"enjoying the curse\" Vaati bestowed upon him. Ezlo snaps, claiming he couldn't care less about his curse, and that all he cares about is stopping Vaati's scheme. Pumped up, Link draws his sword and charges towards Vaati.
